package fixtures

// This package will contain common test fixtures and utilities.
// Fixtures are reusable test data and helper functions that can be
// shared across different test suites.

// TODO: Add common fixtures as needed by test implementations:
// - Common test contexts
// - Standard test data generators
// - Mock data builders
// - Shared test helpers
